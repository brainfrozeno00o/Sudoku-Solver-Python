# Sudoku-Solver-Python

This was made again out of boredom.

A colleague sent me on WhatsApp what PM Lee coded using C++ in C style. He actually made a [Sudoku Solver](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B2G2LjIu7WbdfjhaUmVzc1lCR2hUdk5fZllCOHdtbFItbU5qYzdqZGVxdmlnRkJyYVQ4VU0) which I find really interesting, knowing that he is currently the Prime Minister of Singapore. There is even a [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/leehsienloong/photos/a.344710778924968/905828379479869/?type=3) post about this, and many are really engaged on what he has done.

As boredom struck, I decided to recreate this program in Python as I understand how his Sudoku solver works and possibly compare the performance of running this in Python versus on C.
